might also be paused by the User Agent as an intervention.

SIDE CHANNEL - 3.5 Does this specification expose any other data to an origin
  that it doesn’t currently have access to? Pausing a frame doesn't directly
  expose anything, but one could use side- channel attacks (e.g., measure task
  queue time) to determine if a frame was busy or not by pausing/unpausing and
  seeing the change in task queue latency.
